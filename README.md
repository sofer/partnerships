# Using our model

## Intended audience
This document is intended for those who are interested in using our model to set up a sustainable learning environment and want assistance in doing so.

## Summary
To organisations that share our values, we can offer a training, development and support to help you establish a new venue. 

## Values
Our commitment broadly is to empowering individuals through peer-led learning and collaborative work. Specifically, we are commited to:
+ sharing software through participation in open source software projects;
+ sharing knowledge through the open publication of learning materials;
+ widening access and participation in our programmes.

## Training, development and support 
The key resources required for running a school after our model are a curriculum, experienced personnel, and local knowledge. We are able to help you develop a curriculum, provide staff and training, and assist in developing a sustainable business model appropriate to your locality.

## Sustainability
Our school in London is on a sustainable footing while providing education free at the point of use to our students. We are continuing to refine our business model and to develop a variety of income streams applicable to different environments and with different demographics. Our aim is to create sustainable businesses that provide opportunities to people regardless of their background.

## Costs
We charge for the training, development and support services that we provide. These costs are dependent on the nature of the partnership, the constitution of the partner (commercial vs non-commercial), the location of the project, and the actual services rendered by us.
