# Partnerships

## Intended audience
This document is intended for those who are interested in using our pedagogical model to set up software training schools.

## Values
We are open to partnerships with any organisation that broadly shares our values, as laid out in our statement of purpose.

## Resources
The key resources required for running a school after our model are a curriculum and experienced personnel.

## Personnnel
We can tap into our mentor and alumni network to act an agency for helping to recruit personnel for a new school. The cost of personnel depends entirely on the availability of suitable candidates and their willingness to get involved in the setting up of that school. 

## Curriculum materials
We open source our learning materials, therefore we make no intellectual property claims on that material. However, we only knowingly work with partners, commercial or non-commercial, who share our values and, in particular, respect the principles of open source software and documentation. This does not mean that every project an organisation works on needs to be open source or every part of that organisation needs to be open to public scrutiny, but that .the organisation needs to demonstrate a commitment to participation in open source software projects and to the contribution of learning materials into the public realm.

## Using the name
We would not expect anyone to use our name unless expressly agreed with us. Conversely, we do not expect to have any claim on any organisation that happens to make use of our materials or of staff supplied by us.

## Commercial work
We have sister companies that develop software for clients in London and sub-contract work to our graduates. These companies already have something of a remote working culture and are likely to be capable of sub-contracting work to teams working remotely. We do not ourselves engage directly in commercial software development, but are able to make introductions to our partner companies.
